## How to use
Drag the .jar in your mods folder. Forge will still load it as a dependency.

## Features
- Unlocks ALL cosmetics (including developer). 
- Works with ANY version of Essential/Forge.
- Saves equipped cosmetics to config file `(%AppData%/.minecraft/ecu.txt)`.
- Loads equipped cosmetics from config file when you toggle the `Hide/Show My Cosmetics` button.
- Not a mod, injects and modifies a single class thanks to Mixin.
